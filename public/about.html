<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm Pedro, an advertising professional and computer engineering student passionate about building things that actually work in the real world. I split my time between performance media, analytics, and the curiosity that drives me to understand how systems — digital or human — operate beneath the surface. Whether I'm optimizing campaigns across Meta, Google, TikTok, and Pinterest or studying data structures and electronics, I’m always looking for ways to connect creativity with technical precision.</p>

<p>Over the years, I’ve worked with businesses from multiple niches, creating strategies that combine conversion psychology, data-driven decision-making, and clean execution. I believe in transparent communication, experimentation, and the discipline to turn insights into predictable results. My background in engineering adds structure to my work in advertising, helping me approach problems with a mix of analytical thinking and creativity.</p>

<p>Outside of work and studies, I’m committed to personal growth. I train weightlifting and Jiu-Jitsu, explore neuroscience, and constantly look for ways to improve focus, learn better, and stay grounded. My goal is to build a life where technology, learning, and meaningful work walk side by side — and where I can help people and businesses grow through clarity, strategy, and thoughtful execution.</p>
